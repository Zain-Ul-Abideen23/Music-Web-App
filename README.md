# Music-Web-App
🎶 Music Player Web App

This is a beginner-level Music Player project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to log in and then play a track through a simple, modern UI.


🚀 Features

🎵 Music playback (single track).

🔑 Login form before accessing the player.

🎨 Clean and responsive UI design with gradient styling.

▶️ Play, pause, and control music.


🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – for structure

CSS3 – for styling (gradient backgrounds, buttons, layout)

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – for interactivity and music controls





💡 What I Learned

Handling basic JavaScript events for play/pause controls.

Creating a responsive layout with modern UI design.

Building a multi-page flow (Landing → Login → Music Player).


🎯 Future Improvements

Add support for multiple tracks & playlists.

Create a dynamic music library with JSON or APIs.

Implement user authentication for real accounts.
